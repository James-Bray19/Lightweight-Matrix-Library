 * Example Usage of Lightweight Matrix Library (LML)
 * File: main.c
 * Author: James Bray
 *
 * This example demonstrates the usage of the Lightweight Matrix Library (LML)
 * by performing various operations on matrices such as generating matrices,
 * retrieving data, performing matrix operations, editing matrices, and displaying
 * results. The example showcases the functionality of the library and serves as
 * a reference for developers interested in using LML in their projects.
 * 
 * For more detailed documentation, see the README in the following repo:
